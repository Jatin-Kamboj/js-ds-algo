Linked list is a data structure to store data in it
It is of 2 types
  a. Singly Linked lists
  b. Doubly Linked lists

Status Arrays , We have specifc amount of data which we can use to store the data

Insert and delete is O(n) because indexes change dusring inserting deletion etc

HAshes are not ordered

  To solve the above issues we are gonna use the linked lists

We use pointers in linked lists to manage the refrence of next nodes

Head (first node)
Tail (last node)
  Null terminated
  A node which doesnot have refrence to next node is end of linked list
Node
  value
  pointer(refernce to next node)
