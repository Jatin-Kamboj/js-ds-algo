// what is Imperative and Declarative 

// Imperative means telling the program what to do and how to do it.
// Therefore it is the human who is telling the both things to the program

// Declartive
// Telling the function what to do it but not telling how to do it.
// Such as forEach loop to iterate over all the elements in an array but not telling the
// program how to do it.
// It is the written under the hood in the interperator telling the program how to iterate


// Such as React is decalartive
// We tell it what to do such as render a text in a component but not telling how to to it
// It is pre defined under the hood in the virtual DOM


/**
 * Example of declarative code
 * In below example we tell the program to iterate over an array of (users) [What to do]
 * But we did not tell the program how to iterate over the array. It is predefined in the 
 * Javascript engine
 */

// const users = ["name"]
// users.forEach((user) =>  console.log("name -> ",name))
